- **💻 TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft 🚀 that is a typed superset of JavaScript 🌐. It offers features such as static typing 🙅‍♂️, interfaces 🤝, classes 🏫, modules 📦, and decorators 🎀, making it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript code 🔄 and can run in any JavaScript environment 🌍, including web browsers 🌐 and Node.js 🚀. It has excellent tooling support 🛠️ and is a popular choice for building complex applications 🏗️.**

- **The TypeScript approach used in this code is to add `optional type annotations` to variables, parameters, and return types. This allows the compiler to catch type-related errors at compile time instead of runtime, which can help prevent bugs and improve the reliability of the code.**

- **In this code, the TypeScript approach used is to add type annotations to the variable i and to use the for loop to iterate through a section of an array based on the values of two variables, parenthesisCounter and finalParenthesis. The if statement inside the loop checks if the current element in the array is either a multiplication or division operator, and sets the toLoop variable to true if it is. If the element is not a multiplication or division operator, the toLoop variable is set to false. The toLoop variable is used later in the code to determine whether to continue looping or not.**
