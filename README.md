- **üíª TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft üöÄ that is a typed superset of JavaScript üåê. It offers features such as static typing üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, interfaces ü§ù, classes üè´, modules üì¶, and decorators üéÄ, making it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript code üîÑ and can run in any JavaScript environment üåç, including web browsers üåê and Node.js üöÄ. It has excellent tooling support üõ†Ô∏è and is a popular choice for building complex applications üèóÔ∏è.**

#### Step 1 : install Ts in your IDE
```
npm install -g typescript
```
> Write this command in yout IDE's Terminal
#### Step 2 : Create src and build folder for your project

#### Step 3 :  Put all the html and js file inside the build folder & all the typescript file will be at the src folder

#### Step 4 :  Create a config file Using this command 
``` 
tsc --init
```
> it will create **tsconfig.json** file

#### Step 5 :  Modify mantioned code in ```tsconfig.json``` 
```
"rootDir": "./initializeTS/src", // here you give your src folder path
"outDir": "./initializeTS/build/js", // Here you give your jsvascript file path and 'build/js' will create js folder inside the build folder

// Add this line of code at the end of the tsconfig.json file
,
  "include": [
    "initializeTS/src"
  ]
```
#### Step 5 :  run this command after make changes in json file it will update all the changes of that are maked in json file.
```
tsc -w 
```

- **The TypeScript approach used in this code is to add `optional type annotations` to variables, parameters, and return types. This allows the compiler to catch type-related errors at compile time instead of runtime, which can help prevent bugs and improve the reliability of the code.**

![Screenshot from 2023-03-23 18-31-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122254160/227212237-91394c24-bf63-4f33-9f3a-24a4b3b2b893.png)

- **In this code, the TypeScript approach used is to add type annotations to the variable i and to use the for loop to iterate through a section of an array based on the values of two variables, parenthesisCounter and finalParenthesis. The if statement inside the loop checks if the current element in the array is either a multiplication or division operator, and sets the toLoop variable to true if it is. If the element is not a multiplication or division operator, the toLoop variable is set to false. The toLoop variable is used later in the code to determine whether to continue looping or not.**
